Last lesson I didn't get any work done with the resistors, but this lesson I still didn't do them. I also realised I would have to be happy with my blog for now and change it later. The task for today was to finish a game on the fuze box called the snake game. This was like the game snake, where you control a snake that can move one direction at a time, and you try not to run into yourself and also eat objects that give you points. Using my incredible initiative, I went onto the existing fuze box files, and found a file called Games. I then checked out the game and played it for a while without having to code it myself. I considered copying the file to be my own, but that would be cheationg - and I also needed to know the code. So Keenan and I started copying the code from the booklet. W didnt manage to save it, so we lost our work. I will continue to finish this next lesson. Edgar the Gamer, signing off.
