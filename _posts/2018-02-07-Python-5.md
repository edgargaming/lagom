This lesson Mr.Keen was away, and while we still learnt about python, we didn't focus on anything specific, or have any 'teaching techniques' - we did codeacademy for the lesson. I found a very long course about Boolean variables but more complicated, which took me most of the lesson. My total precentage is now 23%.
