In this lesson, we carried on a little bit with defchar. I changed a heart into a broken heart [though it wasn’t very good], and a space invader into an automatic machine pistol. The I remained the same but I wasn’t particularly worried as we were still ahead of most of the class. After half an hour of playing with position, speed and colour, we decided to finish the assessment and move on. In this chapter, we covered something a bit like input, but not quite. The booklet told us to do some code involving the fuzebox [a.k.a. Rhaspberry pi] asking the user what his/her name was and then responding accordingly. If the name was not recognised, the it would say “You’re new here”, and if it was, it would say “welcome back [name]”. Because we needed something different for the assessment, Keenan and I made it a password. If the password was recognised, the fuze would say “correct password”, and if it was unrecognised, it would say “incorrect password”. We had two possible passwords [our names] for bonus points, and for an extra effect, after 2 incorrect attempts [though we could change it to 3] the fuze would say “[name] has been locked out”. Note: It didn’t do anything, it just made it seem cool.
