Last lesson, I didn't manage to finish the work on the lights. Despite the fact I reread the entire booklet and tried everything with different components, it still didn't work. Our electronics kit didn't have all of the components, so what I thought was the light decector, was something else. maybe a strange resistor. So, while I had fibished all of the LED work with some minor difficulty, i did not manage to complete the resistor task. One thing i should have done was to go and find another electronics kit, but I was too lazy. This held up my learning for one week. because there was no progress on the resistors, I went online and tried to change my blog to somnething cooler. i was already bored with the normal lagom theme.  I tried templates, but some didn't meet my criteria, some didnt work altogether, and I even got a copyright strike threaten from one of the templates. It said something like "Are you stealing my work? Nobody else is here, it must be you...". one thing I did do well is keep on trying to improve my blog. Because IT was closed that day, I didn't make any real progress. Because nothing really happened this lesson, I have been repeating myself and there isn't much to write. This will have been my shortest blog yet!
