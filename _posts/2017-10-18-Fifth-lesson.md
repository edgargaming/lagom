Most of today's lesson was spent just helping other people with their github blogs as pretty much all of the class hade a broken blog. People had simple mistakes - some asked me "How do I change the name on my website" without checking config.yml before. Most of the other people just had 'error 404' or no blogs. After 50 minutes of slaving away, I got back to the task. Now that we had done hvtab we had a task including light bulbs This included placing LED's and other components onto the fuzebox itself. This was difficult as the holes were quite deep, and because most of the wires were bent it was hard to fit them in. We had a red and a blue wire, a wierd colourful thing and an LED. The code on the fuzebox was actually very simple, and it said there were no errors. The code said the the lightbulb will light up for one second [or however long we wanted] and then turning off repeatedly, like a police siren. The LED wasn't lighting up so we asked the teacher but after 10 minutes the bell rang. I think a possible problem was that the wires weren't fully in or that the components weren't working - definitely not the code. Another thing new to us this lesson wa the fact that we had a new fuzebox. This didn't change much, but the layout was different and just new. As my website is all working and nothing is wrong, the only thing I would need to add now would be an avatar, and possible changing the text font.
