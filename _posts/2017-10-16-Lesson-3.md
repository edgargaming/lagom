The start of the lesson was quite disappointing as we found out that we had to save our assessments as well as doing it. As this would take up the entire lesson and we wouldn't learn as much, we asked the teacher if we could only do the latest assessment as he saw us do it before. He said yes so me and Keenan got to work with input and asking questions. This took half an hour and it wasn't new, but I don't know any coding languages so it helped reinforce and remember the fuze basic code. This assessment included asking questions with input code and then giving it back to them in the form of a structured sentence. Next in the booklet, we had a look at defchar and binary coordinate grids. This allowed us to creaete a 11x8 image using binary. We could then move the image and/or change the colour, and also make a short animation [with switching frames]. We could also decide how quickly the frames changed. The default task was to create a " I [heart] [space invaders symbol] ". This was quite fun, and with enough imput code and hard work and about 10 years you could code the actual game. Then we could change the icon and make it, say, a scottish flag. Our homework was to, on a grid, design 3 custom designs.
