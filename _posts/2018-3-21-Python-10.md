Another lesson with 1 hour of codeacademy. Not exactly boring, but less exciting than board demonstrations or repl. I didn't learn anything strictly new, so to say, but I learnt how to use things I already knew in cooler, more interesting ways.
I started off finishing 'A day at the supermarket', which lead onto 'Student becomes the teacher'. Mr Keen had gone through some answers to this 2 weeks ago, and now I understood what he meant.
Michael was also at this stage, so him and I had a little 'race', which made the learning experience more fun, but not rushed. Then I got through two thirds of 'Lists and functions', which brought me up to 50% of the courses complete.
Next lesson will be the last on python, I believe, before drama, but I will still learn python, just slower.
