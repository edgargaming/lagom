Today was another one of those straightforward lessons. Mr Keen decided it was time to catch up on some codeacademy (I seriously needed it) so 60 minutes was devoted to near silent working.
In codeacademy, I finished a course, before doing 2 new ones. I do not remember much, except for working on a pig latin translator. Some of the stuff in lessons earlier was a little complicated, and others were grasping it well.
When defining functions, in the lesson I was simply thinking "What?!", but after the codeacademy course it was much more clear. Things we had done in lessons were part of the courses.
I hastily set to work, to try and get ahead a little bit.
Another thing I realised after the lesson, is most people were using the standard blog template, with the 'what learning habits did I use' and similar questions.
My blogs up to now were just factual reports of what I did. This lesson was just quiet work, with no 'strategies' other than focus and persistance (Mr Keen would wait a while before answering out questions so we could think about it ourselves and not just ask for help all the time. I like this strategy).
Next blog, I will be sure to include some of the template questions, so that my blog matches up with the criteria.
