Wednesdays lesson was another relatively uneventful one, just one hour spent pon codeacademy. This was the third lesson like this I believe.
This week, we were asked to note how far we got on the homework and in the lesson. 
At the start of the lesson, I finished a course called Functions, which I had started earlier. Again, like last week, unknown jigsaw pieces (things we learnt in the lesson) finally formed the bigger picture (They finally made sense).
Then, I finished the lesson doing 'Taking a Vacation', which was a bunch of different tasks using maths. Then, as homework, I did 'Python Lists and Dictionaries', which was about, as the name suggests, lists and dictionaries.
The silent work in the lesson helped me focus, but after a while it got maddeningly boring, and I wanted to do something other than codeacademy, so I looked over to see what Keenan was doing.
'Some other stuff'. I definately need to improve on focus and a 1 hour attention span.
